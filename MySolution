# SE-Assignment-2

(1)Define Software Engineering:
is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software.

(2) What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Engineering is Process-driven, following a defined lifecycle including planning, requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and possibly disposal while Traditional ProgrammingisTask-oriented, focusing on coding for specific tasks. Limited in scope, with less emphasis on planning, design, testing, and maintenance and lastly Often an individual effort, lacking in teamwork and collaboration.

(3) Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. Agile vs. Waterfall Models
Agile Project Management is a repetitive project management approach for building software and applications. This method is quick and easy for both small and large projects and includes customer satisfaction in its priorities. This management approach is mostly used in cases when client requirements change frequently
while Waterfall Methodology is a sequential project management approach that includes some phases each covering a separate part of product development. As it is a sequential approach, so a new phase cannot be started before completing the previous phase, and due to this it is really hard to implement any changes after the phase has been completed so it is not suitable for complex projects.

(4) Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Requirements Engineering

Agile software development:
    Client input is required throughout the product development.
    Changes can be made at any stage.
    Coordination among project teams is required to ensure correctness.
    It is really useful in large and complex projects.
    The testing part can be started before the development of the entire product.
    A Small team is sufficient for Agile project management.
    The cost of development is less.
Waterfall software development:
    Client input is required only after completing each phase.
    Changes cannot be made after the completion of a phase.
    Coordination is not needed as one team starts the work after the finish of another team.
    It is mainly used for small project development.
    Testing can only be performed when the complete product is ready.
    It requires a large team.
    The cost of development is high.
scenarios:
    Using Agile will help meet the customer requirement at the time of the development lifecycle, Agile allows the team to get a higher quality product that meets the customer needs while using waterfall is a sequential project management approach that includes some phases each covering a separate part of product development

(5) What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. Software Design Principles:

Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.

process of requirements engineering
Requirements Elicitation & Analysis: Gathering and analyzing requirements using techniques like interviews and user stories.

Requirements Specification: Documenting clear requirements, including user stories and system specifications.

Requirements Verification & Validation: Ensuring requirements meet stakeholder needs and technical constraints through techniques like prototyping and reviews.

Requirements Management: Tracking and managing requirements changes throughout the development lifecycle.

importance of requirements engineering
Helps ensure that the software being developed meets the needs and expectations of the stakeholders
Can help identify potential issues or problems early in the development process, allowing for adjustments to be made before significant 
Helps ensure that the software is developed in a cost-effective and efficient manner
Can improve communication and collaboration between the development team and stakeholders
Helps to ensure that the software system meets the needs of all stakeholders.
Provides an unambiguous description of the requirements, which helps to reduce misunderstandings and errors.

(6) Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems? Testing in Software Engineering:
 Modularity in software design is the practice of breaking down a software system into smaller, independent modules or components, each responsible for a specific functionality or feature
it improves:
Encapsulation: Modules conceal internal workings, permitting changes within them without disturbing other system components.
Isolation: Errors are confined within modules, simplifying debugging and resolution without system-wide repercussions.
Reuse: Modular structures enable effortless code reutilization across system segments or diverse projects.

(7) Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? Version Control Systems:
Unit Testing:
Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of the software in isolation. These units can be functions, methods, or classes. It ensures that each unit of the software functions correctly as per its design.
Integration Testing:
Integration testing verifies the interactions between different units or modules of the software. It ensures that combined units work together correctly.
System Testing:
System testing evaluates the complete system as a whole. It tests the integrated software to verify that it meets the specified requirements. it ensures that the entire system behaves as expected in real-world scenarios.
Acceptance Testing:
Acceptance testing involves validating the software against business requirements and user expectations. It determines whether the software is ready for deployment. one is able to gain confidence that the software satisfies the stakeholders' needs and is ready for release.

importance of testing
Identifying Bugs: Testing discovers and fixes defects, preventing production issues.
Enhancing Quality: Testing ensures software meets standards, enhancing user satisfaction.
Reducing Costs: Early defect detection saves costs compared to post-deployment fixes.
Ensuring Reliability: Testing strengthens software reliability by eliminating weaknesses.
Maintaining Reputation: High-quality, bug-free software boosts team and organizational reputation.

(8)What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features. Software Project Management:
A version control system is a software tool that tracks changes to a set of files over time.

importance of version control systems:
      
Collaboration: VCS enables multiple developers to work on a project concurrently, merging changes and resolving conflicts.
History and Auditing: VCS maintains a complete history of code changes, aiding in understanding decisions and debugging.
Branching and Merging: VCS allows isolated work on new features or fixes, which can later be merged without affecting the main codebase.
Reproducibility: VCS enables recreation of any previous software version, crucial for bug troubleshooting and version-specific patches.
Backup and Disaster Recovery: VCS serves as a centralized backup, ensuring code retrieval even if local copies are lost or corrupted.

examples:
Git
Subversion
Mercurial

(9)Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? Software Maintenance:

key responsibilities :
Project Planning and Scheduling
Resource Management
